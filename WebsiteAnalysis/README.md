# Project Description

The goal of the “Website Analysis” project is to analyze and classify the links and files contained in a local copy of a website. The system processes websites with 1 to 1000 pages, providing an error message if the site contains fewer than 1 or more than 1000 pages. The project focuses on minimizing the data transfer required and maximizing the speed of analysis, benefiting users by providing efficient and thorough website analysis. The system outputs detailed results in JSON, text, and Excel formats, summarizing the analyzed content.
